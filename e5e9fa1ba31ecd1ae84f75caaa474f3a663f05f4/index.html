        <p>I was selected for the UMSI InfoLab program, which provides the opportunity for students to work on a fast-paced, semester-long project for real-world clients. As a team of four School of Information students, we worked with DocNetwork, which is a leading electronic health records company for camps, childcare, and schools. My team and I have redesigned DocNetwork’s internal health form builder tool for 13 account managers who handle an average of 100 profiles to help minimize errors in medical records. After conducting interviews, as well as survey and usability tests, our team identified three major problems in navigating, editing and organizing questions in the forms. We simplified the process of building and editing electronic health record form to increase productivity by separating the question parameters from the text editing.

        <p>DocNetwork is a company that provides an electronic health record system for schools, children camps and child care providers. Their health record system helps to manage and track any allergies, medications and illnesses/injuries of the children. Recently, DocNetwork has built more than more one million electronic health record profiles for 1,000 health organizations.
        </p>
        <p>In DocNetwork, 13 account managers are responsible for building and maintaining the health record forms for over 100 accounts each. As thousands of parents, campers and staff rely on their health record system, the account managers’ job to review and to avoid any unclear medical forms is very crucial. However, the account managers face productivity challenges as the software is not well adapted to their current workflow and presents challenges in terms of usability an interaction that makes the process of dealing with large forms from several organizations cumbersome and difficult. Therefore, as DocNetwork is doubling in size every year, they have asked our team to help them redesign their internal builder tool that fits the account managers’ workflow and needs.

      <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text">
        <p>First, our team had to understand the full scope of the account managers’ health record form building process. Also, we had to identify any pain points when interacting with the tool and their needs in their workflow. Therefore, our team conducted initial interviews with 6 account managers to study individual habits and patterns of using the builder tool.
        </p>
        <p>In our interviews, we gave the account managers a task and observed each of their form building process using the current tool for 15 minutes to understand their workflow and interaction with the tool. Then, we asked about their reasons behind any frustrations and any challenges while they were building the form. Also, we asked deeper follow-up questions based on each individuals’ challenges and behaviors.

        <p>Since the problems identified in our preliminary research were impossible to rectify with limited time and resources, we decided to concentrate on one of three major problems. We delivered a survey to ask the account managers which option would be more impactful and why. Our survey results showed that the majority of account managers prioritized the “Navigating, Organizing and Editing Questions” problem as the number one pain point.

        <p>In DocNetwork, most account managers struggle with the process of building a health record form from start to end and find these tasks as the most difficult: editing questions, organizing existing information, and navigating the builder tool. Responsible for building and maintaining the health record forms for over 100 accounts, they need a solution that can help them manage a lot of information and questions efficiently and confidently to minimize any potential medical errors.

          <li><p class="subtitle"><strong>Navigation</strong></p>Navigating the current builder is very time-consuming. Account Managers spend too much time sifting through unnecessary information to get to where they need to go.</li>

          <li>The need to manage a large number of questions, applying changes to several of them, and modifying the general structure of the form.</li>
          <li>The separate workflows of returning versus new organizations. One is focused on creating questions from the organization documentation and another is focused on updating information, verifying permissions, reordering, and adding requested changes.</li>
          <li>The need to remember where an account manager last left off while working on an organization’s forms.</li>

        <p>After brainstorming possible features to help our users, our team designed wireframes to check and visualize our functionalities. After sketching and iterating multiple times, we agreed to test our solutions in three major prototypes to fix navigating, organizing and editing form problems:</p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li><p class="subtitle"><strong>Dashboard</strong></p>Dashboard displays an overview of the form the account managers are working on, showing them all the steps as well as displaying starred items and what they were working on previously.</li>
          <li><p class="subtitle"><strong>Edit Mode</strong></p>We designed a more robust form editor to allow for account managers to navigate and edit more efficiently.</li>
          <li><p class="subtitle"><strong>Quick Actions</strong></p>Quick actions feature allows for edits to be made to whole groups of questions within a form.</li>

        <p>After developing our three key prototypes into mid-fidelity prototypes, we conducted usability tests to validate if the prototypes can facilitate the account managers’ tasks. Also, we tested each prototype to define any errors within our prototypes and reveal more specific details of the pain points in the account managers’ workflow.</p>

        <p>On our first usability test, we checked our Dashboard and Navigation screens. The main concept behind the proposed design was to give the account managers an overview and detail approach to form building that allowed them to quickly navigate, access questions and edit the structure of the form.
        </p>
        <p>From this test, we found out some critical points that led to a lot of modifications in first iteration: </p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>Mass action is needed to apply large changes to the form like permission, expiration, deletion, and movement.</li>
          <li>The overview of the form in terms of steps does not add enough value yet. Additional information that can be useful is group permissions.</li>
          <li>The concept of bookmark could be important as some questions are being discussed with the clients, need modifications or new permissions. The account managers would describe this as a ‘to-do’</li>

        <p>After making a lot of modifications based on our previous test, we included easy access to recently modified items, a ‘starred questions’ panel to bookmark questions, steps, etc, and the ability to edit group permissions at the step level on our new version of the Dashboard. With our newer version, we conducted our second usability test to evaluate whether the information and tools available on the Dashboard were useful and if any other pieces of information was needed.
        </p>
        <p>From the second test, we verified the details and information need in Dashboard:</p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>When displaying the last modified questions, it is important to display the complete hierarchy as some questions can have repeated titles under different headers.</li>
          <li>The account managers would use the starred menu as a holder for important questions that need to be updated or discussed with the client or with other account managers. It could be effective to allow the export of these questions in text format to send to organizations for discussion.</li>
          <li>Expiration dates are important to have in the overview of questions and steps.</li>

        <p>For our last usability test before moving onto high-fidelity prototyping, we focused on Quick Actions and Question Edit Mode screens. Quick Actions screen encompassed the functions for modifying the general structure of the form: reordering questions and applying mass action modifications like deactivate, expire, duplicate and permission.
        </p>
        <p>Edit Mode wireframe aimed to separate navigation from form editing by allowing the account managers to input the question parameters in a separate menu so that the general form layout is not affected by the modifications on the question layout.</p>
        <p>From our last testing, we discovered many critical findings that helped us to leverage our high-fidelity prototypes.
        </p>
        <ul class="lists">
          <li>Separating the question preview and text fields from the question and question sections parameters alleviates the visual burden of concentrating all the question parameters in one place.</li>
          <li>There is a need to easily access the questions with certain permissions assigned or certain expiration dates to verify if the correct permissions have been set.</li>
          <li>The account managers use the refresh button as a ‘version control’ tool where they do not save and delete the changes they have made. If no history is implemented, it is important to maintain the concept of saving vs autosave because it allows the account managers to return to a previous stable state.</li>
